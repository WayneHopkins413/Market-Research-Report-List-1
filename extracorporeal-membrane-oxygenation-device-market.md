<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Veno Artrial (VA)</li><li>Veno Venous (VV)</li><li>Artrio Venous</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) device market comprises three primary types: Veno-Arterial (VA), Veno-Venous (VV), and Arterio-Venous (AV). VA ECMO involves blood being drawn from a vein, oxygenated through a membrane, and then returned to an artery, supporting both heart and lung function. VV ECMO primarily assists patients with severe pulmonary issues by oxygenating venous blood and returning it to the venous system. AV ECMO is less common and typically used in specific cases, focusing on providing oxygenation with arterial flow support.</p></p>
