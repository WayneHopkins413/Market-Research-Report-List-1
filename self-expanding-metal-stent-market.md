<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-Expanding Metal Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fully</li><li>Partially</li><li>Uncovered</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The self-expanding metal stent market is categorized into three main types: fully covered, partially covered, and uncovered stents. Fully covered stents have a complete coating, preventing tissue ingrowth and facilitating easy removal. Partially covered stents feature coatings that cover specific areas, allowing for tissue integration while reducing the risk of migration. Uncovered stents lack any coating and are primarily used for structural support, offering better flow but increased risk of tissue in-growth and potential complications.</p></p>
