<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Triple Superphosphate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Granular</li><li>Non-granular</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Triple Superphosphate (TSP) market is segmented into granular and non-granular types. Granular TSP consists of larger, uniform particles that are easier to handle and apply, enhancing soil aeration and minimizing dust during transportation. Non-granular TSP, in contrast, is typically in a powdered form, offering rapid dissolution in soil, making nutrients more immediately available to plants. Both types serve the same purpose of providing essential phosphorus to crops, but their applications and handling differ based on physical properties.</p></p>
