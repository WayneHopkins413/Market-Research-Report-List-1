<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Masterbatches Anti-Static Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Migratory Antistats</li><li>Non-Migratory Antistats</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Masterbatches Anti-Static market comprises two primary types: migratory antistats and non-migratory antistats. Migratory antistats are additives that move to the surface of materials over time, providing temporary anti-static properties but requiring replenishment. In contrast, non-migratory antistats remain embedded within the polymer matrix, offering longer-lasting protection against static electricity. Both types are crucial in various industries, enhancing product performance by reducing static cling, protecting sensitive electronic components, and facilitating smoother processing during manufacturing.</p></p>
